# MPCA GLIMPSE Project

## Overview

This project has been cloned from the EPA GLIMPSE Project

GLIMPSE (GCAM Long-term Interactive Multi-Pollutant Scenario Evaluator; https://epa.gov/glimpse) is a graphical user interface for GCAM (Global Change Analysis Model; https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core), and open-source human-Earth systems model. GCAM is not itself an EPA product. GCAM development is organized by the Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI; https://www.pnnl.gov/jgcri).  

Please note: EPA's GLIMPSE is a separate project from PNNL's GLIMPSE, which is a tool for visualizing power grids and not related to GCAM or integrated assessment modeling. 

## Requirements

We recommend installation on computers with 20 GB of RAM or more and with more than 100 GB of free hard disk space. GLIMPSE consists of two major components: the GLIMPSE-ScenarioBuilder and the GLIMPSE-ModelInterface. The GLIMPSE-ScenarioBuilder currently requires Windows 10 or Windows 11 (although a Mac/Linux version is under development). The GLIMPSE-ModelInterface can be used independently and has been succesfully tested on Mac and Linux operating systems. 

## Important information

Please see the User's Guide, which can be found in the Docs folder, for installation instructions. We also recommend the tutorials as a good starting place for learning to operate many of GLIMPSE's features. Training materials are currently being revised, but we expect that they will be available on https://epa.gov/glimpse at a later date. 

Several additional notes for consideration: 

* You can find the full GLIMPSE downloadable package at the "Releases" link to the right (GLIMPSE-Full-Windows-v1.x.zip). Those who would like to use the GLIMPSE-ModelInterface independently from the rest of the GLIMPSE package can download that executable and associated files (GLIMPSE-ModelInterface-Only-Windowms-v1.x.zip). 
* Please do not install GLIMPSE in a folder that includes spaces in its full path. 
* It is recommended that you modify your computer's power settings such that it will not go to sleep while GCAM is running.
* Please wait for the GLIMPSE-v*.*.zip file to fully download before unzipping.
* Some Windows computers automatically disable execution rights for downloaded EXE and BAT files. Double-clicking will bring up a warning window. Click on the "More Info" button, which will reveal a "Run Anyway" button. This will change the permissions and allow you to execute that file. Alternatively, on some computers, you may need to right-click on the file and choose to unblock it. 
* When naming folders, scenarios, and scenario components, please use alpha-numerical characters, as well as "_" or "-". Spaces or special characters such as ">", "\", "%", or "$" may cause problems when the GLIMPSE software parses the text.
* Windows limits file paths to 256 characters. Because GLIMPSE and GCAM involve many nested folders, some users have experienced problems when installing GLIMPSE to a folder that has a long path. We recommend installing in a location such as C:\Projects\GLIMPSE or C:\Users\USERNAME\local_folder to avoid this problem.     
* As indicated in the Users' Guide, please do not install GLIMPSE to a location that is continuously backed up, such as OneDrive, as this may lead to model execution and synchronization issues.
* The Contrib folder includes files that exceed GitHub size limits if it is unzipped. Unzip this folder after downloading to have access to its contents.

## Starting GLIMPSE

* To start GLIMPSE configured for GCAM-USA 7.0, double-click on "run_GLIMPSE_GCAM-USA-7.0.bat". The tutorials in the Users' Guide have been developed to work with this version.
* To start GLIMPSE configured for global GCAM 7.0, double-click on "run_GLIMPSE_GCAM-global-7.0.bat". This version has not been tested to the same degree, and the Scenario Component Library is includes only a single component.

## Brief Project Description

This repository contains files for teams to reuse when working in and with EPA Open Source projects.

Also, this repository contains the link to [EPA's System Lifecycle Management Policy and Procedure](https://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/policy-procedures-and-guidance-system-life-cycle-management-slcm) which lays out EPA's Open Source Software Policy and [EPA's Open Source Code Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/developers/open-source-software-and-epa-code-repository-requirements). 

## For EPA Teams

For EPA Teams, we have guidance on how EPA puts our open source software policies into practice on GitHub. Read [EPA's GitHub Guidance.](https://www.epa.gov/webguide/github-guidance)

[EPA's Open Source Project repo](https://github.com/USEPA/open-source-projects) is for EPA teams to reuse file for properly maintaining their open source project. All projects must include a readme.md, license.md, contributing.md file and the disclaimer below.   

### Credits

This cloned repository reused material from the EPA GLIMPSE Project, [GSA](https://www.gsa.gov/), [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) , [Lawrence Livermore National Lab](https://www.llnl.gov/), and from the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's policy](https://github.com/cfpb/source-code-policy).
